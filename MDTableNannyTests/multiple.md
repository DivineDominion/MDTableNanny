Creating a table
------

You can create tables with pipes `|` and hyphens `-`. Hyphens are used to create each column's header, while pipes separate each column.


First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell

The pipes on either end of the table are optional.

Cells can vary in width and do not need to be perfectly aligned within columns. There must be at least three hyphens in each column of the header row.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `git status` | List all *new or modified* files |
| `git diff` | Show file differences that **haven't been** staged |

## Formatting content within your table

You can use formatting such as links, inline code blocks, and text styling within your table:
